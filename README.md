# COM 203 Final Project Framework and Instructions

## Framework

This Readme file will provide an overview of your entire project for COM 203 Computer Systems on University Campus. The course final project will be completed in phases. 

To start with, you will be introduced to Git and Github as part of cloud computing. Look at the [tutorial here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) to learn more on GitHub and how to use GitHub services. You will use this tool service and others (later on) as part of cloud tools to develop a group website to submit at the end of the semester (term for online). 

Some basic commands you will want to use are listed in the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

At the beginning of the course you will be given a classroom to work from under GitHub classroom (please wait for your Instructor to priovide the link). All members need to join the group and then identify your group with a name.

## Instructions

Your project will be completed in the following phases:

* Setup of GitHub and Git, all classroom hands-on projects, etc...
* Selection of Jekyll Theme, changes to theme with visible changes
* Research Paper (individual)

### GitHub and Git setup

For this aspect of the project, you will need to capture your installation process of GitHub (Desktop) and Git to your system. For this aspect, you will capture you searching on Goole GitHub Desktop, each process you take to download the software and then the installation process. For example, you should have a capture of the progress bar showing the installation status and then with installation succcess at the end. You will need to add all this to your website later.

Because your personal computers can have multiple versions of programs, languages, and dependancy files it is best to start with a clean installation on a virtual machine. However, this is not mandatory and you are welcome to use your personal system. To understand more about setting up a virtual machine, use the Lab established by your instructor, the [links here] or your personal computer using Oracle, VMWare, or Parallels. All students can obtain copies of Windows licenscening from [here].

You will be given access to GitHub classroom *your own group* repository from which each individual will fork a copy of the templated repository. Make sure you capture this forking process to add to your website later.

*It is important to remember you need to capture all your steps in the installation process* Basically, you will need to provide proof of your installation and processes (each group member) to your own repository/ system. To provide proof you will need to capture images of the steps. Once you all fork your own version you will setup individual pages for each group member to push back to the classroom repository.

### Website - Jekyll theme selection

As a group determine the theme you want to use. Follow the instructions here on how to [setup themes](https://pages.github.com/) on your classroom repository. 

>Welcome to the final component of your project. This is a group assignment to be completed by the last hour of the day of the final. If you do not complete by then, there will not be any opportunity to upload after- which will mean an automatic zero (0) for the assignment. Your website must meet each one of the following requirements for it to be considered successful. If one component is missing it is an automatic zero (0). This assignment is an all or nothing assignment. 

>Website requirements:

>1. Must run from your GitHub pages; Take a screen capture of your page and paste it into D2L.

>2. It must contain a page for each member in your group. The pages are subpages from a home page. Each page must be linked form the home page. You have control on how you create the links. They can be on the right, left, or top. 

>3. Your home page must have some general information about each individual. This is basically a biography.

>4. The individual pages must have some type of blog- instructions that contain the following (your site must be theme related to CS):

>>4.1 Your experience with kano, the pictures you were required to take with your indivudal contribution

>>4.2 Your experience with google cloud platform and Azure.

>>4.3 Your diagrams from each lesson that required them, your final research paper draft, and any other hands-on projects experiences from class

>>4.4 For each indivdual installation captured for GitHub/ Git, provide an explanation of what you did. Make it like an online instruction blog. Basically, teach me.

>>4.5 A link to each research paper for the team members.

>5. If you use any copied code (for example -purchased; i can tell) it will be an automatic zero. 

>This sums up the main items needed for this assignment. You are welcome to do more, however, it is not necessary.

### Research Paper

The final aspect of the *final project* is to add your individual draft research paper to the website.

Research Paper Instructions

>For this assignment you will be required to submit a topic proposal. Submit an APA style Research paper and referencing at least 20 sources. 

>The Term Project assignment offers the opportunity to explore/research a specific topic in computer systems in-depth and present your findings in the form of a written report. Your term project must be 5-10 pages not including a cover page and reference section.

>This assignment must follow APA style.


>The topic selected should include a comprehensive assessment of the basics of computers, the role in which they play, and the needs of an organization and/or person.
